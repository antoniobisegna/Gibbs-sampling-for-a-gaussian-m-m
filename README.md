# Gibbs sampling for a gaussian mixture model
Using a MCMC algorithm - Gibbs sampling - to approach Bayesian model based clustering methods.

## Idea 
I worked on this algorithm as a first try to understand better how Gibbs sampling would work. 
Being more familiar with Gaussian mixture models, I chose this distribution to better understand the sampling algorithm.
My following attempt at Gibbs sampling is in another repository of mine (IN THE WORKS).
